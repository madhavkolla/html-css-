## Deployment

Sublime
•	Sublime was the industry standard in the mid-2000’s
•	Now sublime is the old-dog on the block
o	It will still work fine, however, have there are stronger arguments in favor of using atom.io and webstorm

Dreamweaver
•	Dreamweaver was the industry standard for website creation in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s.
•	Dreamweaver is a WYSIWYG (weeeseeewigggeeee) tool - what you see is what you get
o	It allows you to drag-and-drap items around and dreamweaver writes the code for you
•	As dreamweaver writes the code for you, it can be a big crutch that prevents you from writing and learning the code yourself
•	It is strongly recommended that you do not use dreamweaver
o	Most professional website builders today do not use dreamweaver.
